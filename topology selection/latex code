\section{Topology Selection and Analysis}

\subsection{Design Requirements and Constraints}
The primary objective of this project is to design a DC motor drive capable of providing a controllable output voltage ($V_{out}$) up to $180\text{ V}$. The critical constraint defining the topology selection is the output current ripple frequency requirement:

\begin{equation}
    f_{ripple} > 1 \text{ kHz}
\end{equation}

Standard line-commutated converters (such as controlled thyristor bridges) produce ripple frequencies dependent on the grid frequency ($2f_{grid} = 100\text{ Hz}$ for single-phase, $6f_{grid} = 300\text{ Hz}$ for three-phase). To meet the $>1\text{ kHz}$ requirement, a Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS) approach—specifically a DC-DC chopper—is required. Therefore, all topologies considered utilize a two-stage conversion process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{AC-DC Rectification:} Uncontrolled diode rectification to create a DC bus.
    \item \textbf{DC-DC Conversion:} High-frequency switching to control the motor voltage and satisfy the ripple frequency constraint.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Candidate Topologies}
Three primary topologies were evaluated for this application.

\subsubsection{Option A: Single-Phase Rectifier + Buck Converter}
This topology utilizes a single-phase AC input rectified by a full-bridge diode rectifier, followed by a standard step-down (buck) converter.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simplest implementation and lowest component count.
        \item Easier PCB/Stripboard layout due to fewer power traces.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Disadvantages:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{High DC Link Ripple:} The rectified voltage drops to zero every half-cycle (without capacitance). To maintain a stable DC link voltage above the required motor voltage ($180\text{ V}$), a very large and physically bulky DC-link capacitor is required.
        \item \textbf{High Current Stress:} The single-phase input diodes must handle the full power load, increasing thermal management requirements.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Option B: Three-Phase Rectifier + Buck Converter}
This topology utilizes a three-phase AC input rectified by a 6-pulse diode bridge, creating a DC link that feeds the buck converter (see Figure~\ref{fig:topology_b}).

    \caption{Proposed Topology: Three-Phase Diode Rectifier with Buck Converter}
    \label{fig:topology_b}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Superior DC Link Quality:} The voltage ripple of a 3-phase rectifier is significantly lower (approx. 4\%) and the frequency is higher ($300\text{ Hz}$). The voltage never drops to zero (minimum $\approx 1.5 \times V_{line-peak}$).
        \item \textbf{Reduced Capacitor Requirements:} Due to the smoother rectified voltage, the DC link capacitor can be smaller while still maintaining the ``headroom'' voltage required for the buck converter operation.
        \item \textbf{Load Balancing:} Draws power symmetrically from the grid, which is standard industrial practice.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Disadvantages:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Requires a 3-phase source (available per project specs) and 6 diodes.
        \item Slightly more complex input wiring.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Option C: Synchronous Buck (Half-Bridge) Converter}
This topology replaces the freewheeling diode of the standard Buck converter with a second MOSFET/IGBT.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Regenerative Braking:} Allows current to flow from the motor back to the DC link, enabling active braking.
        \item \textbf{Efficiency:} Lower conduction losses in the low-side switch compared to a diode.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Disadvantages:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Shoot-Through Risk:} Requires precise ``dead-time'' control to prevent shorting the DC link.
        \item \textbf{Drive Complexity:} Requires a complex gate driver with bootstrap circuitry. Given the project timeline and the ``Safe Stop'' requirement (which can be achieved by coasting), this adds unnecessary risk.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

        Risk Factor & Medium (Voltage Sag) & Low & High (Control Logic) \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Final Selection and Justification}
Based on the analysis above and the comparison in Table~\ref{tab:comparison}, the team has selected \textbf{Option B: Three-Phase Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter}.

\paragraph{Justification 1: Voltage Headroom}
The motor requires a maximum voltage ($V_{out,max}$) of $180\text{ V}$. A buck converter can only step down voltage ($V_{out} = D \times V_{in}$). Therefore, the DC link voltage ($V_{in}$) must consistently remain above $180\text{ V}$ plus the voltage drops across switches and inductors.

\begin{equation}
    V_{link,min} > \frac{V_{out,max}}{D_{max}} \approx \frac{180\text{ V}}{0.95} \approx 190\text{ V}
\end{equation}

A 3-phase rectifier provides a stiff DC voltage averaging $1.35 \times V_{LL}$. Using the Variac to provide a line-to-line voltage of approx $150\text{ V}_{rms}$ will result in a DC link of $\approx 200\text{ V}$, providing the necessary headroom with minimal capacitance. A single-phase rectifier would require excessive capacitance to prevent the DC link from dipping below $190\text{ V}$ in the valleys of the AC sine wave.

\paragraph{Justification 2: Reliability and Timeline}
The 3-phase diode bridge is extremely robust and minimizes stress on the DC link capacitor, which is a common failure point. The standard Buck topology (single switch) eliminates the risk of ``shoot-through'' associated with half-bridge topologies, simplifying the gate drive requirements to a single isolated driver. This aligns with the project goal of reaching a robust, working prototype by the demo deadline.

\paragraph{Justification 3: Ripple Requirement}
By selecting a switching frequency ($f_{sw}$) for the Buck converter in the range of $5\text{ kHz} - 20\text{ kHz}$, we inherently satisfy the project requirement of $f_{ripple} > 1\text{ kHz}$.
